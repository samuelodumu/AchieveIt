## Usage guidelines
Not that you need it, but this is a list of uses for AchieveIt vs what it shouldn't be used for:
### Uses:
- Boosting Focus & Productivity: Perfect for users who want to stay on track with time management by using the Pomodoro technique combined with motivational affirmations to stay motivated and productive.
- Improving Mental Well-being: Ideal for those looking to enhance their focus while also benefiting from positive affirmations, helping maintain a balanced mindset during work sessions.
- Encouraging Consistency: The app helps create healthy work habits by breaking tasks into manageable intervals, with positive reinforcement during each Pomodoro cycle.

### What the app shouldn't be used for:
- Complex Project Management: While great for managing time in intervals, the app doesn't support detailed project management features like task assignments, tracking deadlines, or collaborating with others.
- Handling Sensitive Data: Avoid using the app for storing or processing any confidential or sensitive information. It focuses on time management and motivation, not security or privacy management.
- Substitute for Deep Meditation or Therapy: Although the affirmations can be uplifting, the app isn't a replacement for mental health therapy, deep meditation practices, or professional counseling.
